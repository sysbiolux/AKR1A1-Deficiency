The models included the medium component description provided for each cell line type RPMI for 769P and DMEN. They were named in relation to the cell line types and the samples name from the bulk cell transcriptomics data as a reference of the treatments used to build them. The cell lines names were 769-P (we reduced to 7) for Renal cellular carcinoma (RCC) and the Huh7 (we reduced to H) for Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). And for each cell type (7 and H) there is a control siSCR (ctrl) sample and two more conditions samples for the two different treatments with siAKR1A1 and si siAKR1A2 short interfere RNA described in the following table.
