In the present studies, two cell lines were used, a renal carcinoma (RCC) cell line (769-P) and a hepatocarcinoma (HCC) cell line (Huh7). The 769-P and Huh-7 cells were grown on RPMI and DMEM, respectively. For each cell line, 3 conditions are available: control (CTR), and 2 knockdown experiments with different siRNA (siAKR1A1_1, siAKR1A1_2) targeting AKR1A1 (EXP1 and EXP2). Consensus models for each condition were obtained by pooling the data of 3-4 of the replicates and applying rFASTCORMICS (PMID: 31126892). 769-P_siAKR1A1_12 and Huh7_siAKR1A1_12 were reconstructed after pooling the data of EXP1 and EXP2 for the respective cell lines.
